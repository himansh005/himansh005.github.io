> “Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler.” - Albert Einstein

I am a graduate student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) studying computational data science and advised by [Dr. Zachary Lipton](https://www.zacharylipton.com/). My research goal is to **make deep learning models** **safe**, **robust**, and **trustworthy** to catalyze its adoption in critical application areas. I have been fortunate to be advised by excellent professors [Dr. L.P. Morency](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~morency/) and [Dr. Bhiksha Raj](http://mlsp.cs.cmu.edu/people/bhiksha/index.php).

In my previous life, I spent two years building large-scale search, recommendation, and forecasting systems at [Morgan Stanley](https://www.morganstanley.com/). I was also fortunate to gain extraordinarily fresh research perspectives through my internships in AI at three very unique industries – [Locale.ai](https://www.locale.ai/) (location intelligence), [Sigmaways](https://www.sigmaways.com/) (technology consulting), and [S4S Technologies](https://s4stechnologies.com/) (food processing).

I completed my undergraduate degree in computer science and engineering from the [Vellore Institute of Technology](https://vit.ac.in/). I was fortunate to be mentored by [Dr. Balakrushna Tripathy](http://www.bktripathy.co.in/) on my research. Beyond academics, I thoroughly enjoyed devising and implementing AI prototypes for problems in the domains of education technology, woman's safety, and unmanned aerial vehicles. 

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
