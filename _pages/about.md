> “Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler.” - Albert Einstein

I am a machine learning researcher and engineer specializing in LLMs, AI agents, and personalization.

As a researcher, my goal is to make deep learning models safe, robust, and trustworthy to accelerate their adoption in critical applications. I regularly publish my work at top-tier conferences such as [NeurIPS](https://nips.cc/), [ACL](https://www.aclweb.org/), and [ICLR](https://iclr.cc/). To bring my research to life, I build scalable deep learning models that can serve billions of users across unique industrial domains, with a keen focus on the highest standards of code quality. My work bridges deep learning research with scalable AI software, addressing large-scale challenges in trustworthy AI, multimodal intelligence, and LLM infrastructure.

At [J.P. Morgan Chase](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/), I develop AI-driven personalization models serving 90M+ users, including multimodal ranking systems, digital twin agents, and GenAI infrastructure. I thrive at the intersection of cutting-edge research and large-scale deployment, ensuring that innovations in AI translate into real-world impact.

Previously, I spent two years at [Morgan Stanley](https://www.morganstanley.com/) building large-scale search, recommendation, and forecasting systems. Beyond financial services, I explored AI in three diverse industries—location intelligence ([Locale.ai](https://www.locale.ai/)), AI-driven consulting ([Sigmaways](https://www.sigmaways.com/)), and food processing automation ([S4S Technologies](https://s4stechnologies.com/))—gaining a cross-domain perspective on AI applications.

I hold a Master’s in Computational Data Science from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), where I was advised by [Dr. Zachary Lipton](https://www.zacharylipton.com/) and worked closely with [Dr. Louis-Philippe Morency](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~morency/) and [Dr. Bhiksha Raj](http://mlsp.cs.cmu.edu/people/bhiksha/index.php) on LLM adaptation, robustness, and fairness problems. As a CS undergrad at [VIT](https://vit.ac.in/), my research under [Dr. Balakrushna Tripathy](http://www.bktripathy.co.in/) focused on AI applications in education technology, women’s safety, and autonomous systems.

With a mission to push the boundaries of AI research and engineering at scale, I am always exploring ways to make AI more accessible, scalable, and impactful.


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
