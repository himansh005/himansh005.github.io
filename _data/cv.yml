      institution: J.P Morgan Chase & Co.
      year: Feb 2024 - Present
      description:
        - Devised a deep-cross multimodal ranking model for offer category recommendation serving 90M Chase customers, increasing clicks by 12% in A/B tests and driving $100M in revenue; outperformed BAU by 4x and random by 2x in F1 score.
        - Conceived an agentic framework to build digital twins of Chase customers for offline A/B testing our models — fine-tuned LLaMA-3 70B (using RAFT) on GPT-4 distilled tabular interaction data to hyper-personalize agents—first-authored a NeurIPS 2025 paper.
        - Pioneered a distributed LLM inference and fine-tuning framework using vLLM and torchtune on team’s infrastructure, enabling 2 brand new projects, cutting setup time by 8 weeks, and establishing the team’s first GenAI environment.
        - Eliminated feature errors and boilerplate by building a PySpark feature transformation library, enabling 20+ developers to define new jobs in 1 day instead of 7 using simple configs and functional primitives, reducing production model failures by 20%.
